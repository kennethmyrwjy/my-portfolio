## üìö About Me

My background is mainly based on app development. However, I am looking to learn about basically any part of project developments process. I am currently branching out to learn about ML Engineering.
In development, my second priorities are good code architecture and collaboration technique. However, in management, my second priorities are the certainty of its feasibilities and team agreements. And in designing, they are the communication between the designing and the developing teams. My first priorities in all of them is learning.
